##Contributing to Swagger.io
You don't have to code to contribute to the Swagger project. We want this website to be as community-driven as the spec and tooling are. With few exceptions, the pages on this site are generated from content on github. That means we can keep the content open to the community so you can have the site you need (instead of just the site we build).

###Submitting changes to the content
For the pages on our site that are generated from github content (and that's most of them), there is a "View Source on Github" link. That link will take you to the github page that houses the original content. If you want to submit a correction or improvement to existing content, follow normal github procedure by forking the content you want to change and submitting a pull request. We'll review your change and accept it into the site if it makes the content better.

###Adding content to the site
Do you have additional content you'd like to add? Just put your content on github and [send us](mailto:apiteam@swagger.io) the link. If we think it improves the overall site and provides good content for our community, we'll add your page(s) to the site. Because our site pulls content directly from github, you can enhance and modify your content as you see fit, and the changes will propagate to the site immediately.

Any questions on this process, feel free to ask us at [apiteam@swagger.io](mailto:apiteam@swagger.io).
