## Swagger Tools
The Swagger project contains a set of core tools that enable the usage of Swagger in a variety of situations (see table below) - in addition to all the [community tools](open-source-integrations) available around out there. All of these tools are free and open-source projects available under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) on [GitHub](https://github.com/swagger-api), if you find them useful but have some great ideas for improving them, please feel free to contribute to them so we can continue to evolve and improve them.
