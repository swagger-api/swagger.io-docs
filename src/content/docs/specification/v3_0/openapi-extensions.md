Extensions (also referred to as _specification extensions_ or _vendor extensions_) are custom properties that start with `x-`, such as `x-logo`. These are used to add extra information or functionality that the OpenAPI standard doesn't include by default. For example, many tools including Amazon API Gateway, ReDoc, APIMatic, and Fern use extensions to include details specific to their products. 

## Adding Extensions

Extensions are supported on the root level of the API spec and in the following places:

- `info` section
- `paths` section, individual paths and operations
- operation parameters
- `responses`
- `tags`
- security schemes

The extension value can be a primitive, an array, an object or `null`. If the value is an object or array of objects, the objectâ€™s property names do not need to start with `x-`.

### Example

An API that uses Amazon API Gateway custom authorizer might include extensions similar to this:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    APIGatewayAuthorizer:
      type: apiKey
      name: Authorization
      in: header
      x-amazon-apigateway-authtype: oauth2
      x-amazon-apigateway-authorizer:
        type: token
        authorizerUri: arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:account-id:function:function-name/invocations
        authorizerCredentials: arn:aws:iam::account-id:role
        identityValidationExpression: "^x-[a-z]+"
        authorizerResultTtlInSeconds: 60
```
