:::note
OAS **3** This page is about OpenAPI 3.0. If you use OpenAPI 2.0, see the [OpenAPI 2.0 guide](/docs/specification/v2_0/api-host-and-base-path/).
:::

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL. For example, assuming the base URL of `https://api.example.com/v1`, the `/users` endpoint refers to `https://api.example.com/v1/users`.

```yaml
https://api.example.com/v1/users?role=admin&status=active
\________________________/\____/ \______________________/
server URL       endpoint    query parameters
path
```

In OpenAPI 3.0, you use the `servers` array to specify one or more base URLs for your API. `servers` replaces the `host`, `basePath` and `schemes` keywords used in OpenAPI 2.0. Each server has a `url` and an optional Markdown-formatted `description`.

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1    # The "url: " prefix is required
```

You can also have multiple servers, for example, production and sandbox:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1
    description: Production server (uses live data)
  - url: https://sandbox-api.example.com:8443/v1
    description: Sandbox server (uses test data)
```

### Server URL Format

Server URL format follows [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) and usually looks like this:

```yaml
scheme://host[:port][/path]
```

The host can be a name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). WebSocket schemes _ws://_ and _wss://_ from OpenAPI 2.0 are also supported in OpenAPI 3.0. Examples of valid server URLs:

```yaml
https://api.example.com
https://api.example.com:8443/v1/reports
http://localhost:3025/v1
http://10.0.81.36/v1
ws://api.example.com/v1
wss://api.example.com/v1
/v1/reports
/
//api.example.com
```

If the server URL is relative, it is resolved against the server where the given OpenAPI definition file is hosted (more on that [below](#relative-urls)). **Note:** Server URL must not include query string parameters. For example, this is invalid:

```yaml
https://api.example.com/v1?route=
```

If the `servers` array is not provided or is empty, the server URL defaults to `/`:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: /
```

### Server Templating

Any part of the server URL – scheme, host name or its parts, port, subpath – can be parameterized using variables. Variables are indicated by {curly braces} in the server url, like so:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://{customerId}.saas-app.com:{port}/v2
    variables:
      customerId:
        default: demo
        description: Customer ID assigned by the service provider
      port:
        enum:
          - '443'
          - '8443'
        default: '443'
```

Unlike [path parameters](/docs/specification/describing-parameters/#path), server variables do not use a `schema`. Instead, they are assumed to be strings. Variables can have arbitrary values, or may be restricted to an `enum`. In any case, a `default` value is required, which will be used if the client does not supply a value. Variable `description` is optional, but useful to have and supports Markdown ([CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/)) for rich text formatting. Common use cases for server templating:

- Specifying multiple protocols (such as HTTP vs HTTPS).
- SaaS (hosted) applications where each customer has their own subdomain.
- Regional servers in different geographical regions (example: Amazon Web Services).
- Single API definition for SaaS and on-premise APIs.

#### Examples

##### HTTPS and HTTP

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://api.example.com
  - url: https://api.example.com
```

Or using templating:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: '{protocol}://api.example.com'
    variables:
      protocol:
        enum:
          - http
          - https
        default: https
```

**Note:** These two examples are semantically different. The second example explicitly sets the HTTPS server as `default`, whereas the first example does not have a default server.

##### Production, Development and Staging

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://{environment}.example.com/v2
    variables:
      environment:
        default: api    # Production server
        enum:
          - api         # Production server
          - api.dev     # Development server
          - api.staging # Staging server
```

##### SaaS and On-Premise

```yaml
servers:
  - url: "{server}/v1"
    variables:
      server:
        default: https://api.example.com # SaaS server
```

##### Regional Endpoints for Different Geographical Areas

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
    variables:
      region:
        default: westus
        enum:
          - westus
          - eastus2
          - westcentralus
          - westeurope
          - southeastasia
```

### Overriding Servers

The global `servers` array can be overridden on the path level or operation level. This is handy if some endpoints use a different server or base path than the rest of the API. Common examples are:

- Different base URL for file upload and download operations,
- Deprecated but still functional endpoints.

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1

paths:
  /files:
    description: File upload and download operations
    servers:
      - url: https://files.example.com
        description: Override base path for all operations with the /files path
    ...

/ping:
    get:
      servers:
        - url: https://echo.example.com
          description: Override base path for the GET /ping operation
```

### Relative URLs

The URLs in the `servers` array can be relative, such as `/v2`. In this case, the URL is resolved against the server that hosts the given OpenAPI definition. This is useful in on-premises installations hosted on your customer’s own servers. For example, if the definition hosted at `http://localhost:3001/openapi.yaml` specifies `url: /v2`, the `url` is resolved to `http://localhost:3001/v2`. Relative URL resolution rules follow [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). Moreover, almost all other URLs in an API definition, including OAuth 2 flow endpoints, `termsOfService`, external documentation URL and others, can be specified relative to the server URL.

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com
  - url: https://sandbox-api.example.com

# Relative URL to Terms of Service
info:
  version: 0.0.0
  title: test
  termsOfService: /terms-of-use

# Relative URL to external documentation
externalDocs:
  url: /docs
  description: Find more info here

# Relative URLs to OAuth2 authorization and token URLs
components:
  securitySchemes:
    oauth2:
      type: oauth2
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: /oauth/dialog
          tokenUrl: /oauth/token
```

Note that if using multiple servers, the resources specified by relative URLs are expected to exist on all servers.
