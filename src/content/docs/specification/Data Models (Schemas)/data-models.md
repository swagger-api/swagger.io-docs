## Data Models (Schemas)

OpenAPI 3.0 data types are based on an extended subset [JSON Schema Specification Wright Draft 00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00#section-4.2) (aka Draft 5). The data types are described using a [Schema object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#schemaObject). To learn how to model various data types, see the following topics:

- [Data Types](/specification/data-models/data-types/)
- [Enums](/specification/enums/)
- [Dictionaries, Hashmaps, Associative Arrays](/specification/data-models/dictionaries/)
- [oneOf, anyOf, allOf, not](/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/)
- [Inheritance and Polymorphism](/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/)
- [Representing XML](/specification/data-models/representing-xml/)
- [Supported JSON Schema Keywords](/specification/data-models/keywords/)
